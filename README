# Data Analysis Project - Student Database Cleaning and Preparation

## Description

This project focuses on data analysis, specifically the cleaning and preparation of a student database. The main goal is to process raw data, remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and prepare the data for further analysis. This is a critical step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of any future insights derived from the data.

The project includes scripts for:
- Cleaning the data (removing duplicates, fixing formatting issues).
- Handling missing or invalid entries.
- Normalizing and transforming data to fit analytical requirements.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically detects and removes inconsistent, incomplete, or erroneous data.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts the cleaned data into a more useful format for analysis.
- **Easy Customization**: The code is structured to allow easy adaptation for different datasets or new requirements.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and demonstrate the cleaning process.
- **Visual Studio Code**: IDE used for development.
